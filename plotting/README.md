## Example Plotting Code

This section is not a part of the actual app. It includes some example plotting code.  
The code here produces plots like the one below:

<img src="image.png" width="700" height="400" />


*Note:*  
`stations.json` maps codes in the data files to the station names. It was taken from [here](http://mtaapi.herokuapp.com/stations)
